# Variables

# Create a variable called length and assign a value to it
length = 10
# Create a variable called width and assign a value to it
width = 5
# Create a variable called area and assign to it the multiplication of length and width
area = length * width
# Print area in the following: "The result is " followed by the area variable BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables.
print(f"If the length of a rectangle is {length}, and width is {width} then the area is: {area} ")

# Lists

# Create a list named 'favorite_animals' that has four items: dog, cat, monkey, rabbit
favorite_animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'monkey', 'rabbit']
# After creating the list, replace the item that currently holds the value "rabbit" with another animal. It can be any animal you like.
favorite_animals[3] = 'chimpanzee'
# Then using the 'remove' method, remove 'cat' from the list.
favorite_animals.remove('cat')
# Using 'append', add an animal that you like.
favorite_animals.append('lion')
# Print the list to test your code
print(favorite_animals)

# Functions

# Call function to test it out

# Functions Extra
